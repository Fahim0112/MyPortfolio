            My friends say 
            I'm a fool to think
            That you're the one for me
            I guess I'm just a sucker for love
            Cause honestly the truth is that
            
            You know I'm never leaving
            Cause you're my angel sent from above
            Baby you can do no wrong
            My money is yours
            Give you little more because I love you, love you
            
            With me, girl, is where you belong
            Just stay right here
            I promise my dear I'll put nothing above you. above you
            Love me, Love me
            Say that you love me
            
            Fool me, fool me
            Oh how you do me
            Kiss me, kiss me
            Say that you miss me
            Tell me what I wanna hear
            Tell me you (love me)
            
            Love me, love me
            Say that you love me
            Fool me, fool me
            Oh how you do me
            Kiss me, kiss me
            
            Say that you miss me
            Tell me what I wanna hear
            Tell me you love me
            People try to tell me
            But I still refuse to listen
            Cause they don't get to spend time with you
            A minute with you is worth more than
            
            A thousand days without your love, oh your love
            Baby you can do no wrong
            My money is yours
            Give you little more because I love you, love you
            With me, girl, is where you belong
            Just stay right here
            
            I promise my dear I'll put nothing above you. above you
            Love me, love me
            Say that you love me
            Fool me, fool me
            Oh how you do me
            Kiss me, kiss me
            Say that you miss me
            Tell me what I wanna hear
            
            Tell me you love me.
            Love me, love me
            Say that you love me
            Fool me, fool me
            Oh how you do me
            Kiss me, kiss me
            Say that you miss me
            Tell me what I wanna hear
            
            Tell me you love me.
            My heart is blind but I don't care
            Cause when I'm with you everything has disappeared
            And every time I hold you near
            
            I never wanna let you go, oh
            Love me, Love me
            Say that you love me
            Fool me, fool me
            Oh how you do me
            
            Kiss me, kiss me
            Say that you miss me
            Tell me what I wanna hear
            Tell me you love me.
            Love me, love me
            Say that you love me
            
            Fool me, fool me
            Oh how you do me
            Kiss me, kiss me
            Say that you miss me
            Tell me what I wanna hear
            Tell me you love me
